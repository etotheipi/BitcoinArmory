This directory was prepared by forum user, "picobit", and reviewed by the ATI
team.  These notes describe what had to be done on fresh installs of OS X
10.7 (Lion), 10.8 (Mountain Lion), 10.9 (Mavericks), and 10.10 (Yosemite) in
order to get build-app.py working. Except for the first two steps, all steps
are executed from a terminal (aka command line) window.

(1) Install Xcode from Apple's App Store. (It's a free download.)

(2) Run Xcode and install the command-line utilities.
    "Xcode" --> "Preferences" --> "Downloads"

(3) Open a terminal and run "xcode-select --install". You will have to click
    through an EULA and possibly other dialogs.

(4) As seen in Red Emerald's preparation steps for compiling Armory on Mac
    (https://gist.github.com/WyseNynja/4200620), execute the following steps to
    install and update brew:

       ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
       touch ~/.bashrc
       echo "export CFLAGS=\"-arch x86_64\"" >> ~/.bashrc
       echo "export ARCHFLAGS=\"-arch x86_64\"" >> ~/.bashrc
       source ~/.bashrc
       brew update
       brew doctor

(5) Execute "brew install xz swig gettext".

(6) Execute "brew link gettext --force".

(7) "cd" into the "osxbuild" directory, and execute "python build-app.py".
    Armory will be found under the "workspace" subdirectory. Armory.app can be
    moved elsewhere on the system, including under /Applications so that it's
    accessible from the OS X Launchpad.

(8) To avoid runtime issues (e.g., "ImportError: No module named pkg_resources")
    when attempting to run builds on other machines/VMs, make sure $PYTHONPATH
    is empty. In addition, try not to have any "brew"ed Python or Qt modules
    installed. Any of the above could lead to unpredictable behavior.

(9) If running a beta version of Xcode, the build tools will need to point to
    the beta. Open a terminal and run "sudo xcode-select --switch
    /Applications/Xcode-Beta.app". Command line tools should be updated
    automatically. If not, follow instructions given when running "clang".
