This file addresses those distributions of Linux and strains of BSD
not addressed by the main instructions for installing Bitcoin Armory
(i.e. any system which is not Debian, Ubuntu or other Debian
derivatives).  It assumes that your system already has the GNU
development tools (make, gcc, etc.)  installed, along with a later
build of either Python 2.6 or 2.7.  It also assumes that you possess
the necessary privileges to install software on the system (i.e. root
or sudo).

Examples will be given for Slackware 14.1 since any system which is
not Slackware can use the same files to compile relevant parts from
source (which is what Slackware's packaging system does anyway).

1)  Crypto++:  Check that it is not already installed on your system.

    Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora users:  yum list cryptopp
    Slackware:  ls /var/log/packages/ | grep -i cryptopp

If it is not already installed.  The Red Hat brigade can try: yum
install cryptopp, but it may depend on the repositories available.

For Slackware get the source and the build scripts from
slackbuilds.org:

    http://www.cryptopp.com/#download
    http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/libraries/cryptopp/

Extract the build scripts somewhere in /tmp/ and follow the
instructions on the slackbuilds.org site for preparing a package.
This one should just work.  The result will be a Slackware package,
cryptopp-5.6.2-i486-l_SBo.txz in the /tmp directory.  Install it:

    installpkg /tmp/cryptopp-5.6.2-i486-l_SBo.txz

If it didn't build, or your using Red Hat and it wasn't in the
repositories, or your on BSD, Solaris or some even more obscure branch
of UNIX-like system, copy the cryptopp562.zip file to /usr/local/src
and unzip it.  change to the directory it creates and run the make
install dance:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    [make check or make test]  # optional
    make install


2) SWIG will probably already be available on most systems, it is
   installed by default on Slackware.  It appears to be part of
   standard Red Hat systems too, at least as far back as RHEL 5.0.  In
   the event that you are using a system that lacks it, the configure,
   make and make install dance will work here too.

    Downoad it:  http://www.swig.org/download.html
    Extract in /usr/local/src
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    make install


3) PyQt from Riverbank Computing may already be on some systems.
   Slackware 14.1 has it in a standard install and Red Hat appears to
   have older versions available.  If your system does not include
   PyQt, go to the Riverbank website and follow their instructions for
   installing PyQt 4.

4) Everything else can be easily installed within Python itself with
   the aide of PIP:

   https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html

Download the get-pip.py file and then as root run:

   python get-pip.py

PIP will install setuptools if it is not already available.


5) With PIP installed, as root (or through sudo) install Twisted:

   [sudo] pip install twisted

This will retrieve Twisted from https://pypi.python.org along with all
its dependencies (including zope.interface) and install them in the
Python's path (site-packages).


6) Install qt4reactor with PIP:

   [sudo] pip install qt4reactor


7) Optionally install py2exe and/or py2exe2msi and/or PyInstaller
   (with pywin32 if using with Windows).  All of which can be
   installed with PIP except for py2exe for Python 2.x.

   http://www.py2exe.org/
   pip install py2exe2msi
   pip install pyinstaller
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/


8) Learn to love PIP, your dependency resolution for all things
   Pythonic.  More information on PIP is available here:
