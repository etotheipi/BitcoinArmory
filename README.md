# Armory

**Created by Alan Reiner on 13 July, 2011**

**Forked by goatpig in February 2016**

[Armory](https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory) is a full-featured Bitcoin client, offering a dozen innovative features not found in any other client software! Manage multiple wallets (deterministic and watching-only), print paper backups that work forever, import or sweep private keys, and keep your savings in a computer that never touches the internet, while still being able to manage incoming payments, and create outgoing payments with the help of a USB key.

Multi-signature transactions are accommodated under-the-hood about 80%, and will be completed and integrated into the UI soon.

**Armory has no independent networking components built in.** Instead, it relies on on the Satoshi client to securely connect to peers, validate blockchain data, and broadcast transactions for us.  Although it was initially planned to cut the umbilical cord to the Satoshi client and implement independent networking, it has turned out to be an inconvenience worth having. Reimplementing all the networking code would be fraught with bugs, security holes, and possible blockchain forking.  The reliance on Bitcoin Core right now is actually making Armory more secure!

## Sample Code

Armory contains over 25,000 lines of code, between the C++ and python libraries.  This can be very confusing for someone unfamiliar with the code (you).  Below I have attempted to illustrate the CONOPS (concept of operations) that the library was designed for, so you know how to use it in your own development activities.  There is a TON of sample code in the following:

* C++ -   [BlockUtilsTest.cpp](cppForSwig/BlockUtilsTest.cpp)
* Python -   [Unit Tests](pytest/), [sample_armory_code.py](extras/sample_armory_code.py)
