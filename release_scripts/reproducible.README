This README contains information about the use of reproducible builds in the
Armory release process.

The reproducible build integration into the release process caused the step 2
release script to require a couple of extra Python modules. PyYAML is required
to parse the YAML in the assert files that are output by Gitian. PyYAML allows
us to import yaml. The python-debian package is required to parse the buildinfo
file that is output by the Debian Reproducible Build process. That package
allows us to import deb822. Some relevant links are below:

The repo that contains the gathered signatures is located at the following URL:
