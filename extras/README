The scripts in this directory are mostly just toy script, or "scratch-paper" for some operation I needed to do once.  The scripts show a variety of ways to access armory functionality, but there is no guarantee that they work for any apparent purpose (some were created for previous versions of Armory). 

The script, sample_armory_code.py is generally kept-up-to-date, and intended to have a variety of access patterns to illustrate the library usage.  

The script, cli_sign_script.py is a working implementation (as of v0.82) of signing and unsigned transaction from the command line using the full wlalet.


However, there are still no guarantees even for the above two scripts.  If you email me and ask for sample code for something, I am likely to put it in this directory and commit it with the project when I'm done, but not necessarily maintain it.
