This DNSSEC/DANE code is meant to be a proof of concept of an in-progress
project. The code will continue to shift over time.

The getdns API (http://www.vpnc.org/getdns-api/) has a reference implementation
(https://github.com/getdnsapi/getdns) and reference Python bindings
(https://github.com/getdnsapi/getdns-python-bindings) used to create an
easy-to-use API that provides access to DNS and DNSSEC. The following is an
in-order list of the material one will need to get both the getdns reference
code and the getdns Python bindings to work. The directions given may not be
needed for everybody; they're for people building everything from source. (Linux
distros may already have some libraries built in or offered in pre-built
packages.) In addition, some of the libraries may require extra packages. This
file may be missing some of the packages! 

1)libtool  (https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)
-Binaries are required by Expat - Can just install a pre-built package

2)makeinfo  (https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/)
-Binaries are required by libcheck - Can just install a pre-built package
-Package will probably be the "texinfo" package

3)libexpat  (http://expat.sourceforge.net/)
-Run buildconf.sh if you did a CVS checkout
-./configure
-make
-sudo make install

4)libcheck  (http://check.sourceforge.net/)
Optional - Used only to run getdns tests
-./configure
-make
-make check
-sudo make install

5)OpenSSL  (https://www.openssl.org/)
-If building your own OpenSSL, placing everything in /usr/local instead of
 /usr/local/ssl may make things go more smoothly later.
-CFLAGS="-fPIC"
-./config shared no-idea
-make depend
-make
-make test
-sudo make install

6)libidn  (https://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/)
-./configure
-make
-make install

7)libevent  (http://libevent.org/)
-buildconf.sh ONLY if you did a CVS checkout
-./configure
-./make
-./sudo make install

8)ldns  (https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/)
-./configure --with-examples --with-drill
-make
-sudo make install

9)libunbound  (https://unbound.net/)
-autogen.sh ONLY if you did a Git checkout
-./configure --with-ldns --with-libevent --with-ssl
-make
-make test
-sudo make install

10)Run "sudo ldconfig"  (Needed for getdns tests)

11)getdns  (https://github.com/getdnsapi/getdns)
-autoreconf --install
-./configure --with-libevent
-make CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/ssl/include -I."
-make test CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/ssl/include -I../"
-sudo make install
-mkdir /etc/unbound
-unbound-anchor -a "/etc/unbound/getdns-root.key"

12)Run "sudo ldconfig"  (Possibly needed for getdns Python bindings)

13)setuptools  (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)
-Optional - Required by the optional "M2Crypto" Python package
-wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo python

14)M2Crypto  (http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto - https://github.com/martinpaljak/M2Crypto)
-Edit setup.py such that "opensslIncludeDir" & "opensslLibraryDir" point to the
 correct directories.
-sudo python setup.py install

15)getdns-python-bindings  (https://github.com/getdnsapi/getdns-python-bindings)
-Download the "develop" branch from Github.
-If OpenSSL was compiled from source, edit setup.py such that
 "include_dirs = [ '/usr/local/include', '/usr/local/ssl/include' ],"
-sudo python setup.py install
