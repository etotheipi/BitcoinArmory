This code is developed to be as intuitive as possible, even at the expense
of having more lines of code.  For instance, I have endless conversion methods
which are very explicit about the input and output, such as:

   hex_to_binary 
   hex_to_int
   int_to_binary
   base58Str_to_int
   hexPubKey_to_addrStr
   etc

I have shifted most of Sam's code and comments to the bottom of the file, and 
it will eventually be removed entirely once I have succeeded at writing all the
stuff he did, but in my own way.  He will, of course, still get a ton of credit 
for providing such good reference code.  "Lis" from the Bitcoin forums also
deserves a ton of credit for writing a fantastic, dependency-less version of
ECDSA.  This may enable more platforms where this code can be used, as they
don't need to have any particular crypto libraries installed

#####
16 July, 2011:

   After a ton of work, I have finally completed much of the calculation engine!
   All number/binary conversions work, with easy endianness swapping.
   Complete, recursive serialization and unserialization of all block/tx data
   MerkleTree calculation and verification done
   Cryptography library from "Lis" wrapped and tested on arbitrary data
   Most script OP_CODEs implemented, and OP_CHECKSIG works on example tx data!

   Basically, everything else that I need to do (besides networking), should 
   be very easy to implement.  With all the endianness, serialization and 
   crypto methods tested, packet construction, block verification, data
   structures, and crypto anything should be a breeze.

   Of course, this does not include networking.  The networking engine is going
   to be a whole different beast... but luckily Sam's code already has a lot of 
   that written.  When it comes to networking, I might just stick to using other
   people's code, instead of re-writing it in my own way.

   Some immeidate things that I need to do:
      SIGHASH_ALL/NONE/SINGLE/ANYONCANPAY
      Wallet/Account file formats and implementation

   Long term:
      Networking engine (ugh)

ORIGINAL README FROM CAESURE PROJECT - BELOW
********************************************************************************
note: this is *not* a JSON/RPC client, it's an implementation of the bitcoin protocol.

requirements: a relatively recent python, probably 2.5+ or so
either: A) an openssl library.
        B) the pure-python ecdsa package.

I have tested this code using openssl on osx 10.6 (64-bit), linux ubuntu (32-bit), and freebsd-7 (64-bit).

status:

It can connect to a server - preferably on the same host - and download the latest blocks.  stores
the block chain in a simple flat file.  The wallet can store private keys, and can monitor the block
chain for transactions related to those keys.  You can also scan the entire block database (or a
portion of it) for related transactions.

todo:

There's still a lot of work to be done before I would consider it safe to connect
this to the wider bitcoin p2p network.  In the meanwhile, 

name:

It's a pun on the words Caesar and Seizure.  "Render unto Caesar..."

usage:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ python bitcoin.py -c <your-external-ip-address> <other-ip-address>

I recommend connecting to a bitcoin client on your local machine, i.e., 127.0.0.1.

Once the client connects to the server it will start to download the block
database.  This will take a while, even if you're talking to localhost.

You can monitor the progress like this:

from another terminal:
$ telnet localhost 8023

you'll get a python prompt:

>>> the_block_db
<__main__.block_db instance at 0x43bdc8>
>>> db = _
>>> len(db.blocks)
10123
>>> 
>>> len(db.blocks)
18539
>>> 
>>> len(db.blocks)
66029
>>> 
[...]

IMPORTANT NOTE:  If you're running this on a multi-user machine, the python prompt
sitting on port 8023 will be a bad idea.  You have two choices: remove the line that
starts that server (near the bottom of the file, "m = monitor.monitor_server()"),
*or*, if your operating system supports it, bind the socket to an AF_UNIX socket and
telnet to that file.

The monitor interface is there to speed up development, and will eventually be
removed completely - probably replaced by a web admin interface.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

web admin.

In client mode ('-c'), a web admin server is also started up on localhost:
try http://localhost:8380/admin/ (note: that trailing slash is important)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

testnet.

To use testnet, give the '-t' argument along with '-c'.  This will change several
global values, and should NOT impact your block database - it uses different
filenames.  HOWEVER you should use a different wallet path (the '-w' argument).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wallet:

To have access to a wallet, use: [-w <wallet-path>]

$ python bitcoin.py -w wallet.bin
NOTE: NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE OFFICIAL CLIENT WALLET.DAT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than running a client, you can just start up python and play with the block
database.  Both the block database and wallet files are written in append-only mode,
so it's safe to open them read-only from another process, even while the client is
running.

$ python -i bitcoin.py -w wallet.bin

--- receiving bitcoins ---
Just leave the client running.  Once the send shows up in a block, it will be seen
by the wallet and any associated outputs will be reflected in your wallet.

--- sending bitcoins ---
[this needs to be done via the back door so you have access to the client connection]

This will actually send the packet.

Any change that's sent back to you will be acknowledged once it makes it into
