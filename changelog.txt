v0.96.4, released March 30th 2018
== Added ==
   - Updated fee estimate query from node to improve estimateSmartFee call introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.15.
   - The block confirmation target slider now spans from 2 to 100 blocks (previously 2 to 6).
   - You can now pick between 2 fee estimation profiles: conservative and economical. Refer to the estimateRawFee section of
     the Core 0.15 changelog for more information. A tooltip has been added to the GUI with a quick description.
   - If your node does not support the estimateSmartFee method, the code will fallback to the previous estimateFee method.
   - SegWit lockbox creation.
   - BCH lockbox spending.
   - Coin selection will now limit itself to change outputs when spending to external addresses you've spent to in the past.
   - You will receive a warning about privacy loss if coin selection fails to satisfy the previous condition.
   - Added the following CLI args:
      - Client side:
         --force-enable-segwit: when paired with --offline, allows the creation of SegWit types recipient addresses.
         --force-fcgi: forces the client to use FCGI socketing when connecting to a remote DB IP.
      - Server side:
         --listen-all: FCGI server will listen on :80 instead of 127.0.0.1:80
   
== Fixed ==
   - Fixed creating offline transactions that mix P2SH and P2PKH UTXOs.
   - Fixed importing wallets progress report and scan resolution in the GUI.
   - Fixed SegWit sighash data serialization with scripts of length > 256 bytes.
   - Fixed multiple RBF transaction bumping issues.
   - Fixed ledger based fee bumping.
   - Fixed RBF control dialog spawning.
   - Fixed node sync progress bar.
   - Fixed node status notification flicker during node sync.
   - Fixed fragment ID generation mismatching the fragment on backup when restoring non deterministic fragments. This fix only
     applies to fragments generated with versions 0.96.4 and later.
   - When in offline mode, the default signer option will now pick the proper signer for SegWit transactions.
   - Fixed --ram-usage control. --ram-usage=1 will no longer hang the DB during bootstrap scans.
   - As a result, --ram-usage defaults to 50 no instead of 4.
   - Fixed fee calculation when checking "MAX" with SegWit UTXOs
   - The Coin control dialog will no longer spawn invisible
   - When creating a fragmented backup, fragments will no longer be cycled unecessarily
   - Fixed imported address rendering in the Address Book dialog
   - The Transaction Info dialog will now display address comments in the comment field if there is no comment 
     attached to the transaction itself
   - The Transaction Info dialog will now properly display fee/byte fee for unconfirmed transactions   
   - The main transaction ledger will now display comments attached to outgoing addresses for each relevant transaction
   - Fixed selecting an arbitrary wallet file in the Recovery Tool dialog.

== Removed ==
   - You cannot sign messages with P2SH addresses. This functionality never existed in Armory to begin with, as it 
     did not produce single sig P2SH addresses prior to 0.96. It will be introduced in 0.97

== Minor ==
   - You can now resize the Transaction Info dialog.

v0.96.3, released September 21st 2017
== Vulnerability Fix ==
   - Fragmented backups were using a faulty implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS).
     One of the requirement of SSS security parameters is that the coefficients of the curve are chozen randomly. The implementation
     up to this point was deriving these coefficients deterministically.

   - While it is hard to determine how far the deterministic coefficient generation erodes the security of SSS, and how exploitable
     the vulnerability is, the recommendation for users of fragmented backups is to treat the wallets backed up in this fashion as 
     compromised and to migrate all funds to a new wallet. 

   - The fragmented backup code now properly randomizes the SSS coefficients. Fragmented backups created with version 0.96.3 and later
     are safe to use.

   - The result of this change is that fragmented backups will no longer be deterministic. The previous behavior guaranteed a given 
     wallet will always return the same set of fragments for a given M-of-N scheme. Since it deteriorates SSS security properties, 
     the behavior has to be rolled back.
   - Fragment sets are now generated randomly, therefor an unique ID has been added to each set to identify them. You cannot mix 
     and match sets.
   - While Armory can no longer generate deterministic fragments, it can still restore wallets from deterministic fragments.

   - Many thanks to Gregory Maxwell (greg@xiph.org) for identifying and reporting the vulnerability as well as reviewing the fix.

== Fixed ==
   - Fixed faulty version packet deserialization revealed by Core 0.15.0.1
 

v0.96.2, released August 27th 2017
== Added ==
   - Enabled SegWit on the mainnet. Running against a node with WITNESS service bit flagged will allow you to create SegWit addresses.
   - Improved DB scan speed (~80% faster) and stability.
   - Reduced DB memory usage (~20% less).
   - Supernode DB mode. This isn't optimized for consumer grade computers, use at your own risk.
   - The MAX button in the Send dialog has been changed to a checkbox, effect is now binding. 
     Maximum value will be calculated on any change.
   - You can now create OP_RETURN outputs from the Send dialog. This feature is only available in Expert mode.
   - You can now pick the signer of your choosing in Expert mode.
   - Added BCH on top of the legacy and 0.96 C++ signer.
   - Improved verbose on ZC broadcast failure.

== Fixed ==
   - Fixed benchmark timers on POSIX systems.
   - Fixed several Linux build configure bugs.
   - Properly update RPC state in GUI on connect/disconnect events.
   - Various zero conf bugs.
   - Scan progress notification.
   - Properly display comments for non legacy addresses.
   - Digital exports will be saved under the proper file extention in Windows.

== Removed ==
   - Removed armoryd from the repository. armoryd was moved to its own repository (https://github.com/goatpig/armoryd)

v0.96.1, released July 26th 2017

== Added ==
   - Raised default fee to 200 satoshi/Bytes. This fee will apply when using defaults and the node RPC is down.
     Any applied fee lower than that rate will trigger a warning message box. Users have to actively choose to 
     bypass the warning.
   - Split unit tests building from default autotools setup. To build tests, use:
      ./configure --enable-tests.
   - You can now disable GUI in the autotools build system. Use: 
      ./configure --without-gui
   - When spawned with a cookie file, the DB now randomizes its listen port to (49150 + [0-15000]) and reports it in the cookie file.
   - Added --fcgi-port command line argument to the DB
   - Address comments are now visible again in the Coin Control GUI
   - DB messages now have checksums; this improves error and version mismatch detection
   - Transactions that failed to broadcast throug the P2P layer will now be pushed to the RPC afterwards, if it's enabled
   - Refresh address view in Wallet Properties dialog on several user interactions.
   - RPC status is now signaled in the bottom right corner status bar. Disabled RPC will result in bold purple text.
   - Highly improved DB corruption self diagnosis and automated fixing.
   - Zero confirmation parser pool now is now capped at 100 threads. 
     You can modify this value with the --zcthread-pool command line argument.

== Fixed ==
   - ZC parsing will no longer occur while the BDM is initializing
   - Wait on cookie file creation before connecting to auto managed DB
   - Fixed registration/callback premature garbage collection
   - Translation patch issues
   - Fixed "Fund from wallet" lockbox GUI
   - Fixed TxIn/Out pretty printing
   - Tied init phase spinning icon rotation to progress notifications. The icon will not spin when no progress data is received, correctly 
     indicating the DB is hanging.   
   - Fixed cryptopp build against older CPUs (no AES or PCLMUL archs).
   - Fixed RBF bumping with no change.
   - Improved timestamps granularity in logs.
   - Improved transaction broadcast consistency.
   - Improved error message verbose of timed out transaction broadcasts.
   - ./configure --prefix now propagates correctly to Makefiles.
   - Fixed several memleaks in the database code.
   - Fixed false positive throws over bad packet detection in socketing layer.
   - Fixed coin selection edge cases.
   - Fixed the displaying of address comments in the lobby ledger.

== Removed ==
   - Python-twisted dependency. This should remove the underlying openSSL dependency as well.
   - Database command prompt will no longer appear when auto managing the DB on Windows

v0.96, released April 30th 2017

== Added ==
   - 2 new script types have been introduced on top of legacy P2PKH:
      - P2SH-P2PK: nested P2PK script. Uses compressed public keys.
      - P2SH-P2WPKH: nested P2WPKH SegWit single sig output script.

   - Added new signer code to handle the new script types. The code is only used when redeeming outputs using 
     the new scripts. All legacy outputs (P2PKH) are still handled by the original code and can be signed for 
     by previous versions dating back to 0.92.x. New address selection GUI let's the user pick the output script 
     of their choice.

   - The modified offline signing serialization format is backwards compatible. Older version can sign for legacy outputs.
     Older versions can also fund the new types (as they are P2SH scripts). You will need Armory 0.96+ to spend from these
     new scripts

   - Introducing brand new wallet code in C++, using LMDB for system I/O. The new code is compatible with Armory's 
     own chain derivation and can reproduce any existing Armory wallet. Starting 0.96, all existing wallets
     are mirrored to this new format.

   - Wallet mirrors are exclusively watching only (they only contain public data). The new wallet code interfaces with 
     the new address types and signer code. It is used to bridge the wallet data from client to database and distinguish 
     between output scripts.

   - Single address use patterns are preserved. While any wallet can return any of the new output scripts, the new 
     wallet code guarantees requested new addresses originate from fresh public keys and locks public keys to their
     chosen address type.

   - Coin selection logic has been reproduced on the C++ side, with some improvements. It allows for proper interaction
     with satoshi/byte fee options and provides predictive tx size thanks to the new wallet framework.

   - New options have been introduced for fee management:
      - Manual fee/byte.
      - Auto fee/byte.

      Auto fee/byte queries fee/byte from your local node over the RPC. It defaults to the default manual fee/byte on
      failure. UI has been added to the Settings dialog to change the defaults. UI has been added to the Send dialog
      to select fee options on the fly.

   - Added optional auto adjust fee/byte feature. This feature ties back to the new coin selection logic. When using 
     fee/byte options, it attempts to increase your fee in order to lign up the precision of your change output with
     the precision of your spend values. The goal is to obfuscate your change output in conjunction with the existing
     output order randomization, by bluring the difference in value between change and payement outputs. This feature
     improves privacy when applicable.
     
     The fee bump is never more than 10% the original fee value and the coin selection code will prioritize outputs
     that fit this strategy if enabled. This behavior can be turned on and off in the new fee dialogs.

   - Added new change address options, configurable in a new settings tab. The options allow the user to pick the 
     script type of the change address, or automate it.

     When automated, the change output will attempt to match the output script type of the payement address. This
     feature improves privacy by unifying output script types, which obfuscates the change output. 

     If the recipient address types do not match, auto change will create a P2SH-P2PK output (as it uses compressed 
     public keys). Keep in mind that all versions prior to 0.96 cannot redeem these type of P2SH outputs.

     If the transaction is SegWit and the change output is automated, the output script type will be P2SH-P2WPKH.

   - The coin selection code will attempt to consolidate unspent outputs in order to redeem more outputs than it creates. 
     This behavior only takes place if there are available outputs sharing the same address as the already selected ones. 
     This behavior will not inflate the transaction fee by more than 20%.

   - When choosing fee/byte options, the coin selection code will not create a change output if the change is considered
     dust. Dust change refers to a change output with a value lower than the fee it will cost to redeem it. 

     In such case, the change value will be added to the transaction fee instead. This will increase tx priority and 
     improve privacy (as there will be no change output).

   - Reworked the coin control dialog. It now distinguishes between address types. It also allows the selection of CPFP 
     outputs when applicable.

   - Added RBF support. You can create RBF transactions from the Send dialogue. Checking the RBF box will set all input
     sequences to (UINT32_MAX - 2).

   - Modified zero confirmation coloring in legders. Own RBFs are displayed in a teal line. Incoming RBFs are red, child
     ZC (a zero confirmation transaction spending at least one zero confirmation output) are displayed as orange.

   - Your own RBFs have an extra right click menu option, to bump the fee. This will spawn the send dialogue with
     prefilled fields.

   - A coin control like RBF dialog has been added. It can be accessed from the send dialogue, under the Coin Control
     button. It allows you to pick any eligible RBF output to double spend. RBF coin control and regular coin control
     are mutually exclusive. The UX is still experimental, and subject to improvements/redesign.

   - Transactions are now time locked to the current top block. This means miners cannot mine this transaction in a 
     block with a lower height than specified in the nLockTime field. This limits selfish mining attack scenarios, and
     is in line with Bitcoin Core's own wallet practices. 

     Due to a mismanagement of the nLockTime field in previous versions, older signers cannot sign transactions 
     with a nLockTime other than 0. This means that when signing for a legacy P2PKH output with an a pre 0.96 signer, 
     the transaction will default back to a 0 nLockTime.

   - Added the option to force the full redemption of coin control selection. Previously, the coin selection code would 
     pick outputs from within a custom coin control set. This option instructs the code to use the set as is, regardless
     of total spent amount.

   - Added a Tx preview button to the send dialog, to review transactions before clicking "Send".

   - Reworked address ledger in wallet properties dialog. Now distinguishes between address categories (Used, Change and 
     Unused) and address types (P2PKH, P2SH-P2PK, P2SH-P2WPKH)

   - The SegWit address type (P2SH-P2WPKH) can only be used if your local node operates on a chain that has activated SegWit.
     SegWit is disabled on the Bitcoin mainnet through the use of a hardcoded flag.

   - Moved node RPC socketing to ArmoryDB. ArmoryDB now waits on node initiliazation and synchronization processes if it can 
     establish a RPC connection.

   - Migrated build system from raw Makefiles to autotools. This will eventually lead to deterministic builds through Gitian.

   - Added config files for ArmoryQt (armoryqt.conf) and ArmoryDB (armorydb.conf). The config files can take any valid command
     line arguments for their respective binaries (one arg per line). Config file arguments do not override command line 
     arguments

== Fixed ==
   - Fixed transaction count display in wallet properties dialog
   - Fixed wallet group selector in online lobby
   - Fixed lockbox spending
   - Will now properly display updated comments in global ledger
   - Fixed wallet restore features
   - Fixed P2P socketing with refactor Bitcoin Core networking layer (0.14+)
   - Fixed clear mempool feature
   - The bottom right block count indicator in the client now reports node connectivity properly, with tray notifications and
     color coding
   - Fixed interfacing between DB running on a Linux server and clients running on Windows.

v0.95.1, released November 2nd 2016

== Added ==
   - Pass client datadir to auto spawned DB

== Fixed ==
   - Fixed coin control GUI
   - Fixed base58 decode edge case
   - Fixed db version detection
   - Fixed db error message reporting in GUI
   - Fixed explicit db port overwrite in testnet

v0.95.0, released October 23rd 2016

== Added ==

   - Introducing litenode
   - Client and database are now split in 2 binaries: ArmoryQt (client) and ArmoryDB (server)
   - Clients interface with servers over the FCGI protocol. Server is hardcoded to listen on localhost, default port is 9001
   - ArmoryDB can serve remote clients through the use of a HTTP daemon. Example config file for nginx can be found here: 
     ./nginx_example.conf

   - As a result, bitcoin P2P connectivity has been moved from ArmoryQt to ArmoryDB. This means in turn that clients do not 
     require the presence of a local bitcoin node to operate anymore.
   - By default ArmoryQt spawns and controls ArmoryDB. This will not happen in 2 cases:
      _ There is already an instance of ArmoryDB listening on localhost:9001
      _ ArmoryQt has been pointed to specific ArmoryDB through a combination of the new --armorydb-ip and --armorydb-port 
        command line arguments
   - ArmoryDB requires the presence of a bitcoin node on localhost:8333 and access to raw blockchain data like before.
     The change to interface with bitcoin nodes remotely (blocks over p2p) is not in the scope of this release
   - ArmoryDB comes with its own set of command line arguments. They are described here:  
     ./cppForSwig/BlockUtils.cpp:778

   - DB modes are selected with the new --db-type cli arg. It defaults to --db-type=DB_FULL. Also available are DB_BARE and
     DB_SUPER. DB_SUPER has no effect currently, it will be implemented in a future release.   
   - Introducing an extra dataset to resolve random transaction hashes. This database is ~550MB with the current
     blockchain size. This comes in addition to the previous db features of 0.94. This is the default mode, i.e. DB_FULL. 
     To disable this feature (revert to the bare 0.94 db), use --db-type=DB_BARE.
   - You cannot swap db modes on top of an existing db, you will need to build one from scratch instead.

   - ArmoryDB now uses its own log file (dbLog.txt), running in the --datadir folder
   - 0.95 db format changed from 0.94, you will have to build it in another --dbdir
   - Added DB version detection. Mismatch in DB version will result in an error message and termination on the client side,
     a stdout warning on the server terminal side as well as in the db log file.

   - new cli args have been introduced to control db resource consumption:
     _ --ram_usage: int >= 1. Defaults to 4. Each point is worth ~128MB RAM on top of the baseline needs. There is no upper
       bound, be careful when using high values. <= 0 values result in use of default.
     _ --thread-count: int >= 1. Defaults to CPU max thread count. As with ram-usage, use large upper values with care.

   - Improved coin control granularity. You now select UTXOs directly.
   - Added fee per byte options in Send Bitcoins dialog.
   - Failure to broadcast zero confirmation transactions to the network are now reported with the specific reject message
     from your node.

   - Added Segregated Witness read support. This means the database can successfully parse SW transactions.
   - No SW spending feature yet. This will be the subject of another release.

   - Makes use of bitcoind's new cookie authentication in order to access bitcoind's JSON-RPC interface
   - Can now make use of the JSON-RPC calls for estimatefee and estimatepriority regardless of whether Armory is managing
     bitcoind.
   - Those RPC calls will only work if client is local, i.e. ArmoryDB and bitcoind are being run on the same computer as
     ArmoryQt.

== Fixed ==
   - Fixed the missing transaction issue in the Tx Details dialog through the addition of the new resolver dataset

== Removed ==
   - ArmoryQt does not interface nor require the presence of a local bitcoin node to operate online anymore. This 
     functionality has been migrated to ArmoryDB
   - There will be no changes to wallet crypto related operations in this version. Older offline versions of Armory
     (down to 0.92.x) are still compatible with 0.95


v0.94.1, released April 2nd 2016:

== Fixed ==
   - Fixed parsing new blocks with no wallet loaded
   - Fixed wallet/address import
   - Fixed address sweeping
   - .deb installer: will not register shortcuts if /usr/share/desktop-directories is missing

== Removed ==
   - Removed Bitcoin P2P alert parsing, as it was removed from Bitcoin Core.

v0.94.0, released March 27th 2016:

== Added ==
   - New database format: DB shrinked from 60GB to sub 200MB, >10x initial setup and startup speed.
   - New DB corruption detection and auto repair code. Bad block issues should be mostly gone.
   - Detection and GUI flagging of RBF enabled zero confirmation transactions. 
   - Fixed ZC chain handling and replacement. All ZC spending ZC outputs are now flagged as replaceable, 
     regardless of TxIn sequence or parent Tx state.
   - Added new GUI option to add additional entropy at wallet creation using a deck of cards.
   - After the change in lead, all new code is now developed under the MIT license (was AGPL3).

== Removed ==
   - No more phone home code. There are no plans to reintroduce any code of that nature.
   - As a result, the announce tab code is gone.
   - No more torrent code. Seedboxes were hosted by ATI and are now down. Also, IBD improvements in 
     Core 0.10-12 make this code obsolete.
   - As a result of the new light weight DB, the TxHint set has been shrinked to the bare minimum. This means
     Armory cannot resolve arbitrary TxHash to data in block anymore. The main symptom is the inability to 
     resolve TxIn data in the "Transcation Details" dialog. This feature will be reintroduced as part of an
     intermediarry DB format inbetween fullnode and supernode.
   - No more supernode. Will be reintroduced in a later version.
