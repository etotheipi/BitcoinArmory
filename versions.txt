# Maintain this file in the repo so that Armory can always find info
# about the latest version.  This is a good way to document progress,
# anyway...

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.87
   - Inflatable QR Codes Everywhere!
        QR codes added to multiple areas where addresses are displayed,
        including the "Create Clickable Link" window which displays the
        full payment request in the QR code.  Double-click on any QR 
        code to inflate it to full screen.
        
   - Added Paper Backup info to "Backup Individual Keys"
        If you have a lot of imported keys, you can now backup 
        everything using the "Backup Individual Keys" dialog.  It 
        displays the same four lines as on your paper backup, at the
        top of the key list.  Also added option to include the address
        pool to the backup.

   - New Right-Click Menu Options
        The "Transactions" ledger and address lists have new options,
        including links to view the data on blockchain.info.  

   - Real support for Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind 0.8+
        Prior attempt at supporting 0.8 Satoshi client was broken due to 
        incomplete information about the changes.  Support has finally 
        been implemented and tested.

   - Bugfix: Copying Payment Requests
        The "Copy to Clipboard" button on the payment request dialog 
        never worked reliably.  It now copies actually-clickable links 
        that should paste correctly into other applications, such as 
        email apps (Outlook, Thunderbird), and message composition forms
        in webbrowser email sessions.

   - Bugfix: P2Pool Transactions
        Importing wallets with P2Pool transactions no longer crashes Armory

   - Bugfix: Sweeping and Importing Addresses
        Some problems with sweeping have been resolved.  Importing addresses
        already contained in other wallets is prohibited now.  It used to 
        just produce weird answers, now it appears to produce crashes.

   - Billions of Little Bug Fixes
        Special thanks to forum user "subSTRATA" who identified many DOZEN 
        minor bugs and suboptimal features.  Most of them have been fixed
        or upgraded, to create a smoother experience, overall.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.86.3

   - Right-click Ledger Options
        Added right-click menu to ledger for quick access to transaction
        and wallet information.

   - Offline-Sign Confirmation & Warnings
        Offline signing now displays appropriate warnings about what users 
        should verify for before signing and broadcasting.

   - Added Comments to Coin Control (Expert Mode)
        Abbreviated comments are now show in the coin control selection
        window, with full comments availble via mouse-over text.

   - Bugfix: Disappearing Addresses
        Some startup operations were inadvertantly "rewinding" wallets with
        unused addresses, causing those addresses to disappear from the 
        address list, and then shown again when the user requested another
        address.  Resolved.

   - Bugfix: Ledger Sorting
        All fields in the primary ledger are sortable.  Some fields become
        unsortable as a side-effect of ledger optimizations in v0.85.

        

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.86

   - Added "Coin Control" (Expert Mode Only)
        Expert usermode now has the ability to control the specific input
        coins for each transaction, as well as redirect the change output
        to a custom address or return it to one of the inputs.
        
   - Bugfix: Double-Transactions 
        A bug was causing transactions to show up twice for wallets that 
        were just created.  This was resolved by simply restarting Armory.
        Restarting is no longer required.
        

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.85

   - Official Beta Release!
        
   - Multi-threaded, no-wait loading!
        Armory now loads immediately and does all blockchain scanning and 
        rescanning in the background.  All wallet management operations are
        available while you wait!

   - Manual "bitcoin:" URL entry.  
        If clicking on "bitcoin:" links doesn't work on your OS, you can 
        right-click and copy the address string.  There is now a button on 
        the "Send Bitcoins" window that gives you a space to copy the URL 
        and prefill the transaction for you.

   - Preparation for Bitcoin-Qt 0.8+
        Bitcoin-Qt 0.8+ will change up the datadir file organization that
        Armory depends on.  Added code to auto-detect this condition and
        switch to it automatically.

   - Bugfix: No more missing zero-confirmation transactions
        A network bug was interfering with the receipt of nearly 50% of all
        incoming, zero-confirmation transactions.  They would only appear 
        once they had made it into the blockchain.  Armory should now see
        100% of such transactions.

   - Restore Encrypted Backup
        You can now restore paper backups directly to an encrypted wallet file. 

   - Manual Keypool Extension (Expert mode only)
        Wallet properties now tells you how many addresses have been generated
        for your wallet, and lets you generate more, in case a wallet recovery
        operation did not find all your coins.  Alternatively, there is a new
        option, "--keypool=X", to specify how many addresses Armory should    
        watch beyond your last used address in each wallet.

   - *Broke OSX paper backup printing 
        The new multi-threading code has highlighted some bugs in the PyQt 
        implementation that ships with with homebrew on OSX.  So far, no 
        workaround has been found, and users are encouraged to manually write
        down information on your paper backup.
      


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.82.2

   - URL/Link Creator
        Right click on an address in your address book, or press "Create 
        Clickable Link" when you get a new address.  Use this to email 
        payment requests to others, or post payment information on webpages.

   - Minimize-to-system-tray  
        The file menu now has a "Minimize" option, and you can set it to 
        minimize-by-default when you click the "x" on the top window bar.

   - Logging system implemented
        All information normally written to console is now saved to a
        log file in the Armory home directory.  This makes it much easier,
        to report bugs/crashes, especially for Windows users.  Please use 
        "File"-->"Export Log File" to save a copy and send it with your 
        bug reports. 

   - Specify Change Address (Expert Mode Only!)  
        The send-bitcoins window now has options in the bottom-left corner
        to specify how you want change outputs to be constructed.  Either 
        recycle change into existing addresses, or specify an address.  
        
   - New "MAX" button
        New button for each recipient in the send-bitcoins window.  Given
        the values already entered for other recipients and the transaction
        fee, it will compute the max spendable balance for this recipient 
        and insert it into the "Amount" field.  

   - Version Checking and Notification
        When you start Armory, it will automatically check versions.txt in
        the master branch of Armory on github.  It will then notify you if
        your version is older than the latest one.

   - Removed Bitcoin-Qt Wallet Migration
        This was causing more confusion than it was helping.  Given that 
        very few users will benefit from it anymore, it has been removed
        until the new wallet format is finished.

   - Fixed SelectCoins Bug
        Many users reported issues sending coins under some circumstances.        


      


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.81

   - Export Transactions Window
        Export your transaction history in *.csv format.  You can select 
        which wallets to export, sort order, and date format.  

   - Options/Preferences Dialog
        Set your default transaction fee, date formats, usermode, and 
        system tray notifications!

   - Bug fix (Major: spend zero-conf change)
        If Armory needed to use zero-confirmation outputs to construct 
        your transaction, it would crash.  This has been fixed.
   
   - Bug fix (Major: address importing)
        There was an incompatibility between old address importing code
        and the new blockchain engine.  All import/sweep operations should
        work as expected now


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.80

   - New Blockchain Engine!
        Rewrite of the blockchain engine (under-the-hood) that won't crash when
        the blk000X.dat file splits at 2 GB.  It also makes it easier to later
        implement saving data between loads so that it only takes a long time 
        the first time you load, or when you import new addresses.

   - Balances zero-conf tx and sent-to-self change
        There was previously multiple issues with the way that Armory was adding
        up balances that included change outputs and zero-confirmation outputs.  
        This should be fixed  

   - Coinbase Transaction Display
        Coinbase transactions (such as mining in P2Pool) now display properly, 
        and will be not be considered spendable until 120 confirmations
